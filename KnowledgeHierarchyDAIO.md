How It Works:

    Fractionalized NFT Voting:
        NFT holders vote on proposals (e.g., creating agents). Each NFT holder's voting power is based on their fractionalized ownership.
        If the vote reaches 2/3 consensus among NFT holders, it triggers the action (e.g., creating or updating an agent).

    Agent Creation from Votes:
        Agents can be created or updated based on governance votes, including fractionalized NFT holder votes and agent votes.
        The agents can participate in governance through their voting power (determined by their knowledge level).

    Subcommittees for Development, Marketing, and Community:
        Subcomponents (Development, Marketing, and Community) vote on proposals, each contributing 1/3 of the total vote.
        Each subcomponent can have subcommittees, which vote on internal matters and contribute to the overall vote within that subcomponent.

    AI Vote with Agent Sub-Voting:
        Agents within the AI domain vote on proposals. Their votes are aggregated and contribute to the 1/3 AI vote.
        The AI vote represents one of the three components (alongside Development, Marketing, and Community).

    Proposal Execution:
        A proposal is considered for execution once it has aggregated votes from all components (including the AI vote).
        The AI vote is factored in as 1/3 of the total votes, while the other components contribute the remaining 2/3.
        If the total votes reach 2/3 majority, the proposal is executed.

Key Features:

    Fractionalized Voting: Allows NFT holders to vote on proposals, ensuring decentralized ownership and decision-making.
    Agent Voting for AI: Agents within the AI domain contribute to the overall AI vote through their individual knowledge-weighted voting power.
    Subcommittees: Each component (Development, Marketing, Community) can form subcommittees, adding more layers of decision-making before final consensus.
    AI Consensus: The AI vote is an aggregation of agent votes, making it a dynamic and intelligent decision-making process.

This design effectively integrates fractionalized NFT voting, agent creation and management, and subcomponent governance, while maintaining the DAIO framework's 1/3 AI vote and 2/3 human vote structure.
