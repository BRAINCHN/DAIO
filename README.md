DAIO: Decentralized Autonomous Intelligent Organization

The Decentralized Autonomous Intelligent Organization (DAIO) is an advanced governance model that combines fractionalized NFT voting and token-based ERC20 governance with AI influence. The system is designed to enable decentralized decision-making for organizations where both human and AI votes play a role in reaching consensus.

This repository contains two distinct governance contracts:

    FractionalizedNFTVoting: A governance model where voting power is based on fractionalized NFTs, with 2/3 AI voting influence in each subcomponent (Development, Marketing, and Community).
    ERC20AgentGovernance: A governance model using ERC20 tokens for voting on proposals, including creating agents, with AI having voting power in each subcomponent.

The repository also includes the full DAIO White Paper, which describes the overarching architecture, goals, and use cases for the DAIO system.
